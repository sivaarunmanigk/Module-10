# # Stack-Stack Reversal Program 

This Python program demonstrates how to reverse the values in a stack using basic stack operations like push and pop.

##  Aim

To write a Python program that reverses the values in a stack using standard stack operations.

##  Algorithm

1. Create an empty stack.
2. Read an integer `n` from the user (number of elements to push).
3. Loop `n` times:
   - Read an integer from the user.
   - Push it onto the stack.
4. Create an empty list called `reverse`.
5. While the stack is not empty:
   - Pop the top element.
   - Append it to `reverse`.
6. Print the reversed list.


### Program:

```python

stack = []
  n=int(input())
  for i in range(n):
     value=int(input())
     stack.append(value)
  reverse= []
  while stack:
     reverse.append(stack.pop())
  print(reverse)

```
